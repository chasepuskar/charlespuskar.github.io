# Work

## Special Course Work
<!---
Showcase your abilities by presenting work of which you are especially proud. We recommend 3 or so samples of especially difficult, creative, or noteworthy work done for a course. For exmaple, a design project, a fourier project, a particularly difficult proof from "APPM Analysis class", a paper you wrote in German for a class, etc.
-->
## Creative Work
<!---
This can take a variety of forms.  It can be creativity in a design project, creative writing (poetry, fiction, etc.), visual art (drawing, painting, video work, etc.); video/audio of musical work; musical scores; video of performances; etc.
-->
## Writing Samples
<!---
The ability to communicate well is essential to almost any type of success.  This section should present 2-3 writing samples that demonstrate your ability to organize your thoughts, the quality of your reasoning and the clarity of expressing your thoughts.  Your Symposium speech from Critical Encounters I could be your first posted sample.  This writing could be from a class, but it could also be something related to research, an article you are working on or something you are presenting to a non-academic group.

## Senior Design Projects
<!---
You may choose to include a comprehensive presentation of your senior design project: it's scope, purpose, driving question, technical problem being addressed, process, outcome, etc. Again, this could be an imbedded powerpoint presentation, a narrative, etc.  You should include multiple pictures or video.  A main goal of this section would be for potential employees or grad schools to be able to see what you did in your senior design project/thesis.
