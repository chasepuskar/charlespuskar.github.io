## Philosophy of Education
<!---
This will be discussed and completed in your Critical Encounters I course. As a "philosophy" of education, this section should communicate what you think about education and why you want to be educated in this manner.  The reader should learn what kind of learner you are, how you prioritized different aspects of your education, etc. This can also include why you chose Applied Math or Mechanical as your major, why you chose x or y as your minor, why you earned a certificate, why you were involved in EHP,  etc.--especially if the fit isn't readily apparent.  You can also discuss what you hope to gain from your education; why you chose your various activities (service, research, internships, being an LA, playing in the band, study abroad, etc.); the role collaboration has played in your education; how you selected your electives; etc.
