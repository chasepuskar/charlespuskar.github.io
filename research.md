# Research
<!---
Present any research work you have done--for a class, in someone's lab, during an REU or an internship.  Include pictures, video, powerpoint presentations, visuals, etc. where relevant. This section will be especially interesting to grad schools, employers, potential research advisors (at REUs, etc.).
