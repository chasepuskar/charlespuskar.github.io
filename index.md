<img src="images/rocket.jpeg" alt="" align="right" height="440" hspace="20"/>  My name is Chase Puskar, welcome to my Engineering Portfolio!

I am an aspiring aerospace engineer, and have been as long as I can remember.  I am a senior undergraduate Engineering Honors student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a declared Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering Sciences and a minor in Computer Science. This upcoming Spring 2019, I plan on concurrently enrolling as a graduate student in Aerospace Engineering Sciences, with a focus in Astrodynamics & Satellite Navigation Systems or Autonomous Controls. I am an Eagle Scout and the current Vice President and previous Academic Chair of my fraternity, Theta Xi Alpha Eta.

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the Colorado Center for Astrodynamic Research, developing software to detect, localize, and characterize GPS/GNSS jammers and spoofers.

In my free time, I enjoy app development, skiing, camping, backpacking, rock climbing, and making music.
