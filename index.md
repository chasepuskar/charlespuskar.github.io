My name is Chase Puskar, welcome to my Engineering Portfolio!

I am an aspiring aerospace engineer, and have been as long as I can remember.  I am a junior undergraduate Engineering Honors student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a declared Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering Sciences and a minor in Computer Science. This upcoming Fall 2019, I plan on concurrently enrolling as a graduate student in Aerospace Engineering Sciences, with a focus in Aerospace Systems and Automated Controls. I am an Eagle Scout and the current Vice President and previous Academic Chair of my fraternity, Theta Xi Alpha Eta.

In my free time, I enjoy coding and app development, skiing, camping, backpacking, and rock climbing, and listening to and making music.
