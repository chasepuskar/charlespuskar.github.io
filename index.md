I am an aspiring aerospace engineer, and have been as long as I can remember. I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a declared Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering Sciences and a minor in Computer Science. This upcoming Fall 2019, I plan on concurrently enrolling as a graduate student in Aerospace Engineering Sciences, with a focus in Aerospace Systems and Automated Controls. I am an Eagle Scout, the current Vice President, and the previous Academic Chair of my fraternity, Theta Xi Alpha Eta.

In my free time, I enjoy coding and app development, skiing, camping, backpacking, and rock climbing, and listening to and making music.

Currently looking for a Summer 2019 Internship!
