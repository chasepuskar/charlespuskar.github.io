# Projects

## RocketSat 12: Avionics Engineer

RocketSat 12 was a project through the Colorado Space Grant Consortium, contributing a payload to NASA’s 2018 RockSat-X sounding rocket.  This project's objective was to receive and process RF signals from a local Doppler Nexrad station in order to determine the signal VCP and the payload's radial velocity relative to the station using doppler shift. I joined the project a few month before launch, and worked on the Avionics team from May 2018 until September 2018. The project was used Python 3 and Linux running off of a Raspberry Pi 3, and made use of a HackRF One Software Defined Radio peripheral to receive signals. While working on the Avionics team, I was responsible for fixing faulty components of the Avionics subsystem and debugging the system's malfunctioning software. I wrote a majority of the system's final code, and made integral contributions to the subsystem to prepare the project for flight. The project failed to determine the payload radial velocity due to resolution constraints from available hardware, but successfully characterized the nearby signal VCP.


## Miura II: Flight Software Team

Miura II was also a project through the Colorado Space Grant Consortium, contributing a payload to NASA’s 2018 High Altitude Student Platform. This project tested the pressurized deployment of a soft-shell, insulated, expandable structure in a near-space environment. This project was the second iteration of a previous project researching an expandable structure deployed using the Miura-Ori folding method. his project also used a Raspberry Pi running Linux and was written almost entirely in Python 3. I joined this project during the proposal phase during November 2017 and worked on it until flight in September 2018. While on the Flight Software team, I contributed to the full design phase of the project, including the project proposal and several design reviews. I wrote a majority of the project's flight software, which operated a motor, several solenoid valves, and heaters for the system, included serial communication with a ground station to allow command based operation of the payload, and included a series of emergency protocol in the case of hardware failure during the pressurization of the payload.


## Gateway to Space: Team Co-Lead/Software Lead

Researched the viability of water as a shield against dangerous particle and electromagnetic radiation found in space and near space as a part of the ASEN 1400 course. Designed, built, launched, and recovered a high-altitude balloon satellite with an integrated Arduino Uno microcontroller and an analog sensor package. Found water to be highly effective against alpha and beta type particle radiation, without harmful secondary radiation associated with metallic shielding methods. Software Lead. 


## Unreal Events: App Developer

A startup to facilitate event creation and planning. Developed an iOS application allowing organizers to choose artists, production, security, and media team for event, including point of sale integration. Swift 4.
